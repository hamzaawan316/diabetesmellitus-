Predicting Proteomic in Diabetes Mellitus Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning
This repository contains the code used in the study titled "DiaProteo: A Supervised Learning Framework for Early Detection of Diabetes Mellitus based on Proteomic Profile". The code is structured to facilitate feature selection, model building, and explainable AI analysis to predict including Type-1 Diabetes, Type-2 and insulic diabetes.

Repository Structure
This repository contains three main Python scripts:

Feature Selection
This script implements Positional features, in addition to statistical moment-based features for feature selection. It helps identify diagnosis the most important Diabetes Mellitus Proteomic.

Prediction Modeling
modelling_olink.py
This script builds the prediction models using the selected features. Various machine learning classifiers are trained and evaluated for their ability to predict Diabetes Mellitus Proteomic.

Usage
Each script can be run independently (made to run in python). Ensure that the input data (Diabetes Mellitus) is correctly formatted as expected by the scripts. Modify the paths and any configuration settings as needed.

Availability
The dataset is currently available upon request. Please contact me Hamza Shahab Awan (hamzashahabawan@gmail.com  /  sp24-pcs-006@cuilahore.edu.pk) or any of the authors for access.
